# Overall Evaluation

I'm looking for overall structure, and reading through the readme to make sure that:

1. The instructions are clear and work
2. The code is organized in a sensable mannor
3. There are no secrets commited into the code
4. The goals where met

The top level pass through is normally really quick. Making sure nothing major is missing and the `README.md` is written in a clear way. I'll then follow the steps in the README file
to validate that the instructions work. Where there may be ambiguity i'll take notes to discuss with the candidate if they move on to the next phase.
